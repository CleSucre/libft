# My personal library used on my personal projects

## What is it?

This library is a project initiated by [42](https://www.42.fr/) school. It is a project that consists in recoding a set of C standard library functions, as well as other utility functions that will be useful for future projects.

## How to use it?

To use the library, you need to compile it first. To do so, run `make` in the root directory of the project. This will create a `libft.a` archive. You can then link it to your project with the `-L` and `-l` flags. For example, if your project is in a directory called `my_project`, you can compile it with `gcc -L my_project/libft -lft my_project/*.c`.
